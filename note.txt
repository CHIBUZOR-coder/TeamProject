✅ RECOMMENDED RULESET for Collaboration (BEST PRACTICE)
1️⃣ Ruleset basics

Ruleset name: "your prefered name" ✅

Target branches:default

Branch name pattern → main ✅

(If you don’t set target branches, the rules won’t work.)

2️⃣ Rules you SHOULD enable ✅ (important ones)
🔒 Core protection (MUST HAVE)

✅ Require a pull request before merging

This is the most important rule

No one pushes directly to main

✅ Required approvals: 1

Team lead or senior must approve

For small teams, 1 is enough

✅ Require conversation resolution before merging

All PR comments must be resolved

✅ Block force pushes

Prevents breaking main

🧠 Good team practices (RECOMMENDED)

✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

If someone updates code, it must be reviewed again

✅ Require approval of the most recent reviewable push

Prevents self-approval tricks

3️⃣ Rules you should ENABLE only if needed (OPTIONAL)

⚠️ Enable later when the team grows:

⬜ Require linear history

Use only if your team understands rebase

⬜ Require review from Code Owners

Only if you use CODEOWNERS file

⬜ Require status checks to pass

Only if you have CI (tests, GitHub Actions)

⬜ Require signed commits

Usually for enterprise / open source

4️⃣ Rules you should NOT enable (for now) ❌

❌ Restrict creations
❌ Restrict updates
❌ Restrict deletions

These can block everyone, even admins, if misconfigured.

❌ Require deployments to succeed
❌ Require code scanning / code quality
(Only useful with advanced pipelines)

5️⃣ Bypass list (VERY IMPORTANT)

Add:

Team lead

Admins

So they can:

Fix emergencies

Resolve conflicts

Unblock PRs

6️⃣ Final “checkbox summary” (copy this)

✔ Require a pull request before merging
✔ Required approvals → 1
✔ Dismiss stale approvals
✔ Require approval of most recent push
✔ Require conversation resolution
✔ Block force pushes

Everything else → leave unchecked

🧠 One sentence to remember (interview-ready)

“We protect the main branch by requiring pull requests, approvals, and blocking direct pushes, while allowing only admins to bypass rules.”

You’re setting this up exactly like a real team 👌
If you want, I can:

explain why each rule exists

suggest a setup for intern-only repos

explain rulesets vs old branch protection





//Changing roles in colaboration

********How can i change coloborators role in a git hub colaboration

To change a collaborator's role on GitHub, you must have admin access to the repository. The process varies slightly depending on whether the repository is owned by your personal account or an organization.

For Repositories Owned by an Organization
Organizations allow for granular roles (Read, Triage, Write, Maintain, Admin).

Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub.

Under your repository name, click Settings. (If you don't see the tab, click the ... dropdown menu first).

In the left sidebar, locate the Access section and click Collaborators and teams.

Under the "Manage access" list, find the person or team whose role you want to change.

Select the Role dropdown menu next to their name and click the new role you want to assign.

For Personal Repositories
Personal repositories have a simpler permission structure. Usually, you either add someone as a collaborator (which gives them Write access) or they have no access.

Navigate to your repository and click Settings.

In the left sidebar, click Collaborators.

If they are already added, you can manage their access here. Note that for standard personal accounts, "Collaborator" typically equates to full write access.

If you need more specific roles (like "Read-only"), you may need to move the repository into an Organization (which is free to create).

Common GitHub Roles Explained
Role	Best For...
Read	Non-code contributors who only need to view or discuss the project.
Triage	Contributors who need to manage issues and pull requests without write access to code.
Write	Active contributors who push code to the project.
Maintain	Project managers who need to manage repository settings and milestones.
Admin	Full access to the repository, including sensitive settings and deleting the repo.
Note: If you are trying to change your own role, you cannot do so. Only another Admin can change your permissions.

Would you like me to walk you through how to create an organization so you can use these more specific roles?

i dont see any icon to edit their role and i creatd the repo

If you created the repository and don't see an icon or dropdown to change the role, it is almost certainly because the repository is owned by your personal account rather than an Organization.

The Reason
GitHub handles permissions differently based on the account type:

Personal Repositories: These do not have "roles." When you add a collaborator, they are automatically given Write access. There is no "Read-only" or "Triage" setting for collaborators in a personal repo; they either have full push access or no access at all.

Organization Repositories: These allow you to select specific roles (Read, Write, Admin, etc.) from a dropdown menu.

How to Check
Look at the URL of your repository:

github.com/YourUsername/RepoName → Personal (No roles available).

github.com/OrganizationName/RepoName → Organization (Roles available).

What you can do
If you need to restrict a collaborator to "Read-only" or "Triage" access, you have two options:

Option 1: Move the Repo to an Organization (Recommended)
This is free and gives you full control over roles.

Create a new GitHub Organization.

Go to your Repository Settings > General.

Scroll to the bottom to the Danger Zone and click Transfer.

Transfer it to your new organization.

Once transferred, go to Settings > Collaborators and teams, and you will now see the dropdown menu to change roles.

Option 2: Use "Protected Branches" (Workaround)
If you want to keep the repo personal but prevent them from messing up the code:

Go to Settings > Branches.

Click Add branch protection rule.

Enter main (or your default branch).

Check Require a pull request before merging. This forces the collaborator to submit code for your approval rather than pushing directly.

Since you want to enforce a professional workflow where collaborators must use branches and pull requests (PRs), here is exactly what you should tick under the "Require a pull request before merging" section:

1. Required: "Required reviews"
Action: Set the number to 1.

Why: This ensures that code doesn't just sit in a PR—someone has to look at it. If you want to be the only one who can approve, you will be the one providing this review.

2. Recommended: "Dismiss stale pull request approvals..."
Action: Tick this box.

Why: If a collaborator gets an approval, but then sneaks in more (potentially broken) code to the same branch, this setting clears the old approval. They will need a new review for the new changes. This is a very important security/quality step.

3. Recommended: "Require conversation resolution before merging"
Action: Tick this box.

Why: If you leave a comment/critique on their code (e.g., "Fix this variable name"), they cannot merge the PR until they have marked that conversation as "Resolved." it prevents them from ignoring your feedback.

What to leave UNTICKED (for now):
Require review from Code Owners: Leave this unticked unless you have created a special CODEOWNERS file in your repo.

Require review from specific teams: Leave this unticked (this is mostly for large companies).

Allowed merge methods: You can leave these as default (usually all three are checked). This just decides if the "Merge" button on GitHub uses a "Create a merge commit," "Squash," or "Rebase" style.

Summary of the Workflow you are creating:
Collaborator creates a branch and pushes changes.

Collaborator opens a Pull Request on GitHub.

You (or another peer) review the code and leave comments.

Collaborator fixes issues until all "conversations are resolved."

You give the final "Approve."

The PR is finally allowed to be merged into main.

One last tip: Make sure you scroll to the bottom and click "Save changes" or "Update" once you've checked these boxes!
